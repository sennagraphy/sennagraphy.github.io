        <h1>Axie Infinity Report 2025</h1>
        <p><strong>March 7, 2025</strong></p>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Axie Infinity, the original play-to-earn pioneer, peaked with a $4 billion economy and 2.5 million daily users by 2021. Fast forward to 2025, it's still hanging on—despite AXS plunging from $163+ to $3.44-$3.65. Can it reclaim its throne? This report dives into Axie’s 2025 status through economic shifts, user activity, ecosystem features, and strategic outlook. Sources include the 2021 Whitepaper, Messari, CoinGecko, and Etherscan (March 2025).</p>
        
        <h2>Main Report</h2>
        
        <h3>Performance Metrics</h3>
        <p>At its 2021 peak, Axie generated over 1 million ETH (~$4 billion) in economic activity (Whitepaper)—driven by NFT trading and staking. By 2025, Messari and CoinGecko show no official TVL, but the fully diluted market cap sits at $932.8–$985.5 million. AXS has dropped 97.9% from $163.29. Etherscan reports a $580.9 million circulating cap, with holdings concentrated in Ronin Bridge (41.28%) and Token Swap (35.03%). Trading volume now ranges between $20.43M–$41.5M—far below the peak, but signs of stabilization are emerging.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <p>Axie’s ecosystem still runs on play-to-earn. DAU dropped from 2.5–2.7 million (2021) to 100,000+ in 2025 (Messari, @InspectorMNBL on X, March 3). The 2024 Bounty Board helped drive a 516% DAU spike—from 12,000 to 74,000. Origins DAU rose 80%, Classic jumped 233%. NFT trading continues: Etherscan shows 1.8 million token transfers, including a 240.1 AXS sale for $811.04. Breeding (AXS/SLP) and rare Axies still drive activity, albeit at lower volume. Tokenomics remains consistent: AXS for governance, SLP for utility, all built around a player-owned economy (Whitepaper).</p>
        
        <h3>Strategic Insights</h3>
        <p>In 2025, Axie’s outlook is mixed. AXS has seen a 3.05–7.42% price uptick, and DAU sits above 100,000—signs of life. But a 67% YoY drop and rising Solana-based competition weigh heavily. The Bounty Board boosted revenue by 35% (Messari, 2024), yet high token concentration in Ronin Bridge and Token Swap introduces risks. With only 51.21% decentralization, Axie still trails true Web3 standards. Long-term survival depends on tightening tokenomics and launching fresh gameplay to stay ahead.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Axie Infinity in 2025 isn’t dead—it’s adapting. With 100,000+ DAU and minor price recovery, the project still has a heartbeat. But the $4B glory days are gone. NFT activity and its loyal community offer hope, yet bearish pressure and tough competition demand more than survival. Without bold moves, Axie could fade into a niche. The potential's still there—it just needs reigniting.</p>
