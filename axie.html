        <h1>Axie Infinity Report 2025</h1>
        <p><strong>March 7, 2025</strong></p>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Axie Infinity, the play-to-earn pioneer, soared to a $4 billion economy and 2.5 million daily users by 2021. In 2025, it clings to relevance despite an AXS price crash from $163-$164 to $3.44-$3.65. Can it reclaim its glory? This report probes Axie’s 2025 state through economic trends, user metrics, ecosystem features, and strategic outlook, using the 2021 Whitepaper, Messari, CoinGecko, and Etherscan data (March 2025).</p>
        
        <h2>Main Report</h2>
        
        <h3>Performance Metrics</h3>
        <p>Axie’s 2021 peak saw over 1 million ETH ($4 billion+) in economic activity, per the Whitepaper, implying a massive TVL from NFT trades and staking. By 2025, Messari and CoinGecko report no direct TVL, but a fully diluted market cap hovers at $932.8-$985.5 million, with AXS down 97.9% from $163.29. Etherscan pegs the circulating cap at $580.9 million, concentrated in Ronin Bridge (41.28%) and Token Swap (35.03%). Trading volume spans $20.43-$41.5 million, reflecting a steep drop from its heyday, though stabilization hints at minor recovery.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <p>Axie’s ecosystem thrives on its play-to-earn core. Daily active users (DAU) hit 2.5-2.7 million in 2021 but stabilized at over 100,000 in 2025, per Messari and @InspectorMNBL (X, March 3). The 2024 Bounty Board spiked on-chain DAU from 12,000 to 74,000 (+516%), with Origins DAU up 80% and Classic 233%. NFT trading persists—Etherscan logs 1.8 million token transfers, like 240.1 AXS for $811.04—driven by breeding (AXS/SLP) and rare Axies, though at lower volumes. Tokenomics (AXS for governance, SLP for utility) and a player-owned economy remain its backbone, per the Whitepaper.</p>
        
        <h3>Strategic Insights</h3>
        <p>Axie blends grit and hurdles in 2025. A 3.05%-7.42% price uptick and 100,000+ DAU signal resilience, but a 67% yearly drop and Solana game rivalry weigh it down. The Bounty Board lifts revenue 35% (Messari, 2024), yet token concentration in Ronin Bridge and Token Swap raises risks. At 51.21% decentralization, it lags Web3 ideals. Survival hinges on balancing token supply-demand and outpacing competitors with fresh mechanics.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Axie Infinity in 2025 retains a pulse with 100,000+ DAU and modest price gains, but it’s a shadow of its $4 billion peak. User base and NFT activity endure, yet bearish trends and competition cloud its path. Without bold innovation, Axie risks settling as a niche player—its community and mechanics offer hope, but traction demands more.</p>
